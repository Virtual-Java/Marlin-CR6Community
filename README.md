# Community firmware for touchscreen printers (like Anycubic Vyper or Creality CR-series)
- Anycubic Vyper
- Various contributed configurations (like Solcon, Ender 3 with touch screen, and CR-200b)

## Downloads

At present there are no binary downloads since the STM license conditions for some of the libraries used restrict execution to STM devices only, the Vyper mainboard uses a non-STM device. 
You may take this source and build for your board but it is your responsibility to ensure it is running in accordance with the license conditions.


### Development and compile-it-yourself

If you have the Platform.io plugin installed in Visual Studio code you can open the folder to start with the code.

There are several configurations for the build of the source and they can be found at line 75 onwards of the configuration.h file:
// %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
// %%%% Options for building Vyper image %%%%

// select build type here
//#define VYPER_BUILD         // standard
#define VYPER_BUILD_LA      // with linear advance and junction deviation enabled
//#define VYPER_BUILD_LA_T    // as above but with uart connection to TMC2209's for x, y, z and z2
//#define VYPER_BUILD_LA_TE   // as above but with software serial connection to e stepper

// Leave undefined to home Z using two Z sensors (stock configuration)
//#define VYPER_NOZZLE_HOMING // home Z using nozzle sensor at middle of bed

// NOTE to use nozzle sensor any adjustable Z sensors must be set to maximum
// extended length so sensor is detected before nozzle reaches bed

Most users will probably want to use the VYPER_BUILD_LA option since this runs on the stock main board and gives the extra linear advance and junction deviation options for better prints (once calibrated).

The _T and _TE options are for use with a modified main board where the main board has been user modified to add uart connections to the TMC2209 drivers.

There are also two options for homing of the Z axis;
1. The standard way as used by Anycubic which uses the two Z axis photo sensors, one on each side, to determine the home position of each of the Z axes. 
	The home sequence is lift Z to avoid anything on the bed, 
	move head on X gantry until the X limit switch is triggered and stop, 
	move bed towards back of printer until the Y limit switch is triggered and stop, 
	the z motors lower the axis until the sensor associated with each motor is triggered to stop that motor, so each motor is independant, e.g. left motor triggers left sensor and stops, right motor continues until right sensor triggers and stops.
2. The alternative way which uses the nozzle probe sensor to determine the home position of the Z axes at the centre of the bed. 
	The home sequence here is the same as for the standard way above except after the Y limit is triggered the head is moved to the centre of the bed,
	the Z motors then lower the head until the left Z sensor is triggered,
	the Z motors continue until the nozzle probe is triggered, i.e. bed is detected, and both Z motors stop,
	the Z motors will raise the head slightly and then lower it again until the bed is again detected, this is the home position for Z.
	
There advantages and disadvantages to using the nozzle as Z home position, the mesh values will be closer to 0 and thus will show less red or blue but homing will not complete without a working sensor. Also the Z 'flags' used to trigger the Z axis sensors need to be lower than the nozzle, this is the case with fixed flags but the adjustable ones MUST be set to protrude as far below as possible else the nozzle will impact the bed.


## Purpose of this community firmware

Initially started with the goal of providing an alternative firmware for the Anycubic Vyper motherboard

- Providing better firmware than the default firmwares provided by Anycubic
- [Expanding the features](https://github.com/CR6Community/CR-6-touchscreen) of the limited default touch screens delivered with 3d printers

- Still expanding the features of the touch screen and merge upstream
- Continuously update this fork to the latest Marlin stable versions
- Provide builds for some printers by default, for the less technically inclined

## Contributors

Marlin is constantly improving thanks to a huge number of contributors from all over the world bringing their specialties and talents. Huge thanks are due to [all the contributors](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/graphs/contributors) who regularly patch up bugs, help direct traffic, and basically keep Marlin from falling apart. Marlin's continued existence would not be possible without them.

## Administration

Regular users can open and close their own issues, but only the administrators can do project-related things like add labels, merge changes, set milestones, and kick trolls. The current Marlin admin team consists of:

The current core Community firmware dev team consists of:



Marlin and the Community Firmware is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.



## Marlin 2.1 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__
Ensure you take the right assets: the `[firmware/main-board]-[suffix].bin`. You should not download the `Source code` archive if you are downloading with the purpose of directly flashing the firmware onto your printer.

Marlin 2.1 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.1.x release version. Periodically this branch will form the basis for the next minor 2.1.x release.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Example Configurations

Before you can build Marlin for your machine you'll need a configuration for your specific hardware. Upon request, your vendor will be happy to provide you with the complete source code and configurations for your machine, but you'll need to get updated configuration files if you want to install a newer version of Marlin. Fortunately, Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations) repository to find the right configuration for your hardware.

## Building Marlin 2.1

To build and upload Marlin you will use one of these tools:

- The free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) using the [Auto Build Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/auto_build_marlin.html) extension.
- The free [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) : See [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
- You can also use VSCode with devcontainer : See [Installing Marlin (VSCode devcontainer)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_devcontainer_vscode.html).

Marlin is optimized to build with the **PlatformIO IDE** extension for **Visual Studio Code**. You can still build Marlin with **Arduino IDE**, and we hope to improve the Arduino build experience, but at this time PlatformIO is the better choice.

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin includes an abstraction layer to provide a common API for all the platforms it targets. This allows Marlin code to address the details of motion and user interface tasks at the lowest and highest levels with no system overhead, tying all events directly to the hardware clock.

Every new HAL opens up a world of hardware. At this time we need HALs for RP2040 and the Duet3D family of boards. A HAL that wraps an RTOS is an interesting concept that could be explored. Did you know that Marlin includes a Simulator that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux? Join the Discord to help move these sub-projects forward!

## 8-Bit AVR Boards

A core tenet of this project is to keep supporting 8-bit AVR boards while also maintaining a single codebase that applies equally to all machines. We want casual hobbyists to benefit from the community's innovations as much as possible just as much as those with fancier machines. Plus, those old AVR-based machines are often the best for your testing and feedback!
